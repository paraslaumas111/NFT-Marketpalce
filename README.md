#About -

NFT Marketplace (Tech Stack: Express.js, React, Node.js, Motoko)

 • Designed a sophisticated Decentralized Application (DApp) enabling users to mint, buy and sell NFTs (Non-fungible
 Tokens) using a newly created cryptocurrency token “DANG” on the Internet Computer Blockchain (ICB).
 
 • Created robust smart contracts using the Motoko language to facilitate secure and transparent NFT transactions.
 
 • Integrated “Internet Identity”, a 3rd party authentication partner, to provide an anonymous and secure blockchain
 authentication framework supported by the ICB.
 
 • Enabled users to view their owned NFTs and list them for sale on the open market by setting a price in “DANG” tokens.
 Listed NFTs can be purchased by any user with the required “DANG” tokens, except the owner.
 
 • Utilized JavaScript’s Promise-based functions extensively to ensure smooth and efficient execution of asynchronous
 operations.
